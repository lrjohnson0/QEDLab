___Thank you for your interest in the QED lab!___

Our research is focused primarily on quantitative and theoretical work in ecology. Our application areas are fairly broad – see the research and publication pages for a better idea. Our research is driven by a desire to understand biological problems. Theory and methodology are developed as tools for the biological problem, and not typically as an end in and of themselves (although the theory and methods can end up being pretty fun).

### Postdoctoral Opportunities

It is a pleasure to host postdoctoral researchers, research associates, visiting scholars, etc. When funded positions are available, they will be advertised publicly on the VT jobs site and on listservs such as ECOLOG-L, and posted on this website in the "news" section. Other interested candidates should email me with appropriate materials (e.g., CV) and proposed ideas for research and for funding mechanisms. I am happy to work with exceptional candidates to secure funding.

### Student Opportunities

I am keen to hear from students interested in doing a Ph.D. (or in exceptional circumstances, an M.S.) in the lab, as well as undergraduates looking for research experience. I can currently accept graduate students through Statistics or Biology. I look for students who are interested in developing a thesis in quantitative/mathematical/statistical biology or statistical ecology, preferably in topics such as infectious disease ecology and evolution or individual behavior and life history strategies, and who have undergraduate training in:

- applied math, probability/statistics, computer science or engineering.
- biology, especially ecology and evolution

Students with training in biology need to have or be willing to learn quantitative skills, and those with a quantitative background need to be willing to learn the biology.

If you’re an interested graduate student, please take a look at the graduate student section of the biology/statistics departmental websites. They give some very helpful information about graduate life at Virginia Tech, expectations within the department, and how to apply. Then, please send me an email with your CV and an idea of your particular interests and we’ll chat.
