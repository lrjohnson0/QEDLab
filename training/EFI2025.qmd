## Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce Gaussian Process (GP) modeling for forecasting time dependent ecological data and demonstrate applications to tick abundance
in the NEON Forecasting Challenge. The workshop is part of the [2025 Ecological Forecasting Initiative Conference](https://eventee.com/en/e/ecological-forecasting-initiative-2025-conference-22413) being hosted by the [VT Center for Ecosystem Forecasting](https://ecoforecast.centers.vt.edu/)  at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu). The workshop is designed as a guided workshop combining a short lecture together with a hands-on component taking approximately 1.25 hrs.
