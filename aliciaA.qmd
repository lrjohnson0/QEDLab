## Bio 

I am a PhD student in the biology department at Virginia Tech. I am broadly interested in using statistical and mathematical models to make sense of biological data. For my dissertation, I am using mathematical models to explore how bird feeders play a role in transmitting disease in wild birds. In the QED lab, I am working on a project to determine how life history data can be shared across species of ticks to improve our understanding of the prevalence of less studied tick species.
