## Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech. I am interested in ecology across scales - understanding how current patterns of biodiversity reflect environmental conditions as well as historical patterns of evolution. I am particularly interested in ecological responses to changing environments - from life history responses through to population and community dynamics. Currently, I use statistical and mathematical models to better understand and predict patterns of covariation between life history traits in disease vectors and other arthropods.
