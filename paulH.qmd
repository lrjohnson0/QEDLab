## Bio

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech. I use statistical and mathematical models to better understand and predict patterns of covariation between life history traits in arthropods. I am generally interested in ecology across scales â€“ understanding how current patterns of biodiversity reflect environmental conditions as well as historical patterns of evolution. More specifically, I am interested in advancing a mechanistic understanding of how thermal adaptation in arthropod disease vectors could affect VBD transmission risk and vector control effectiveness.
