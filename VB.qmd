## VectorByte

[VectorByte](https://www.vectorbyte.org/) is a 5-year NSF [Division of Biological Infrastructure grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2016264&HistoricalAwards=false), awarded to [Leah R. Johnson (Virginia Tech)](leah.html), [Sadie J. Ryan (University of Florida)](http://www.sadieryan.net/), [Samuel Rund (University of Notre Dame)](http://sites.nd.edu/samuel-rund/) in collaboration with [Samraat Pawar (Imperial College London)](https://mhasoba.pythonanywhere.com/pawarlab). VectorByte will establish a global open access data platform for biological trait and abundance data for human and non-human disease vectors. It will also provide analysis tools and training to a wide audience of researchers and practitioners.

## VectorBiTE RCN

[Leah Johnson](leah.html) was the US PI of the Vector Behavior in Transmission Ecology Research Coordination Network ([VectorBiTE RCN](http://vectorbite.org/)). The VectorBiTE RCN was a join NIH and BBSRC funded initiative that seeks to

-   increase the interaction between researchers in the diverse fields studying Vector-borne diseases
-   encourage collection and consolidation of key data, and
-   encourage development of analytical tools to better understand the role of vector behavior in transmission ecology.

**Although funding has ceased, the VectorBiTE Network is continuing. See the old website at [www.vectorbite.org](http://vectorbite.org/)**
