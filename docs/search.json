    "text": "We are a statistical and quantitative biology lab working at the intersection of statistics, biology, and mathematics. At a broad level, our research focuses on understanding how differences between individuals in a population result from external heterogeneity and stochasticity, and how this variability influences population level patterns.\nWe address these questions primarily in the context of infectious disease epidemiology, as well as in behavioral and population ecology. Our approach is to use theoretical models to understand how systems behave generally, while simultaneously seeking to confront and validate models with data and make predictions. Thus, a significant portion of our research focuses on methods for statistical — particularly Bayesian — inference and validation for mechanistic mathematical models of biological systems.\nResearch questions in the QED lab fall into three complementary areas:\n\nThe ecology of infectious diseases\nThe evolution of individual behaviors or life history strategies and the implication of individual traits on population dynamics and persistence\nInference methods (primarily Bayesian) for mechanistic models of biological systems"

However, we do not have a traditional data set with an obvious input space. What is the X? \n\nWe made a few plots earlier to help us identify what can be useful:\n\nX_1 Iso-week: This is the iso-week number\nLet’s convert the iso-week from our target dataset as a numeric i.e. a number. Here is a function to do the same.\n\n# This function tells us the iso-week number given the date\nfx.iso_week &lt;- function(datetime){\n  # Gives ISO-week in the format yyyy-w## and we extract the ##\n  x1 &lt;- as.numeric(stringr::str_sub(ISOweek::ISOweek(datetime), 7, 8)) # find iso week #\n  return(x1)\n}\n\ntarget$week &lt;- fx.iso_week(target$datetime)\nhead(target)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  datetime   site_id variable             observation iso_week  week\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2015-04-20 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum        0    2015-W17    17\n2 2015-05-11 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum        9.82 2015-W20    20\n3 2015-06-01 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum       10    2015-W23    23\n4 2015-06-08 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum       19.4  2015-W24    24\n5 2015-06-22 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum        3.14 2015-W26    26\n6 2015-07-13 BLAN    amblyomma_americanum        3.66 2015-W29    29\n\n\n\nX_2 Sine wave: We use this to give our model phases. We can consider this as a proxy to some other variables such as temperature which would increase from Jan to about Jun-July and then decrease. We use the following sin wave\n\nX_2 = \\left( \\text{sin} \\ \\left( \\frac{2 \\ \\pi \\ X_1}{106} \\right) \\right)^2 where, X_1 is the iso-week.\nUsually, a Sin wave for a year would have the periodicity of 53 to indicate 53 weeks. Why have we chosen 106 as our period? And we do we square it?\nLet’s use a visual to understand that.\n\nx &lt;- c(1:106)\nsin_53 &lt;- sin(2*pi*x/53)\nsin_106 &lt;- (sin(2*pi*x/106))\nsin_106_2 &lt;- (sin(2*pi*x/106))^2\n\npar(mfrow=c(1, 3), mar = c(4, 5, 7, 1), cex.axis = 2, cex.lab = 2, cex.main = 3, font.lab = 2)\nplot(x, sin_53, col = 2, pch = 19, ylim = c(-1, 1), ylab = \"sin wave\", \n     main = expression(paste(sin,  \" \", (frac(2 * pi * X[1], 53)))))\nabline(h = 0, lwd = 2)\nplot(x, sin_106, col = 3, pch = 19, ylim = c(-1, 1), ylab = \"sin wave\", \n     main = expression(paste(sin,  \" \", (frac(2 * pi * X[1], 106)))))\nabline(h = 0, lwd = 2)\nplot(x, sin_106_2, col = 4, pch = 19, ylim = c(-1, 1), ylab = \"sin wave\", \n     main = expression(paste(sin^2,  \" \", (frac(2 * pi * X[1], 106)))))\nabline(h = 0, lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome observations:\n\nThe sin wave (period 53) goes increases from (0, 1) and decreases all the way to -1 before coming back to 0, all within the 53 weeks in the year. But this is not what we want to achieve.\nWe want the function to increase from Jan - Jun and then start decreasing till Dec. This means, we need a regular sin-wave to span 2 years so we can see this.\nWe also want the next year to repeat the same pattern i.e. we want to restrict it to [0, 1] interval. Thus, we square the sin wave.\n\n\nfx.sin &lt;- function(datetime, f1 = fx.iso_week){\n  # identify iso week#\n  x &lt;- f1(datetime) \n  # calculate sin value for that week\n  x2 &lt;- (sin(2*pi*x/106))^2 \n  return(x2)\n}\n\nFor a GP, it’s also useful to ensure that all our X’s are between 0 and 1. Usually this is done by using the following method\nX_i^* = \\frac{X_i - \\min(X)}{\\max(X) - \\min(X) } where X = (X_1, X_2 ...X_n)\nX^* = (X_1^*, X_2^* ... X_n^*) will be the standarized X’s with all X_i^* in the interval [0, 1].\nWe can either write a function for this, or in our case, we can just divide Iso-week by 53 since that would result effectively be the same. Our Sin Predictor already lies in the interval [0, 1]."

First, we specify priors using darg and garg. We will specify a minimum and maximum for our arguments. We need to pass the input space for darg and the output vector for garg. You can look into the functions using ?function in R. We set the minimum to a very small value rather than 0 to ensure numeric stability.\n\n# A very small value for stability\neps &lt;- sqrt(.Machine$double.eps) \n  \n# Priors for theta and g. \nd &lt;- darg(list(mle=TRUE, min =eps, max=5), X)\ng &lt;- garg(list(mle=TRUE, min = eps, max = 1), y)\n\nNow, to fit the GP, we use newGPsep. We pass the input matrix and the response vector with some values of the parameters. Then, we use the jmleGPsep function to jointly estimate \\theta and g using MLE method. dK allows the GP object to store derivative information which is needed for MLE calculations. newGPsep will fit a separable GP as opposed to newGP which would fit an isotropic GP.\n\n# Fitting a GP with our data, and some starting values for theta and g\ngpi &lt;- newGPsep(X, y, d = 0.1, g = 1, dK = T)\n\n# Jointly infer MLE for all parameters\nmle &lt;- jmleGPsep(gpi, drange = c(d$min, d$max), grange = c(g$min, g$max), \n                 dab = d$ab, gab=  g$ab)\n\nNow, we will create a grid from the first week in our dataset to 1 year into the future, and predict on the entire time series.

We need to back transform our predictions to the original scale.\n\n# Back transform our data to original\ngp_yy &lt;- fi(yyt)\ngp_q1 &lt;- fi(q1t)\ngp_q2 &lt;- fi(q2t)\n\n# Plot the observed points\nplot(as.Date(df$datetime), df$observation,\n       main = paste(site_names[site_number]), col = \"black\",\n       xlab = \"Dates\" , ylab = \"Abundance\",\n       # xlim = c(as.Date(min(df$datetime)), as.Date(cutoff)),\n       ylim = c(min(df_train$observation, gp_yy, gp_q1), max(df_train$observation, gp_yy, gp_q2)* 1.05))\n\n# Plot the testing set data \npoints(as.Date(df_test$datetime), df_test$observation, col =\"black\", pch = 19)\n\n# Line to indicate seperation between train and test data\nabline(v = as.Date(cutoff), lwd = 2)\n\n# Add the predicted response and the quantiles\nlines(grid_datetime, gp_yy, col = 4, lwd = 2)\nlines(grid_datetime, gp_q1, col = 4, lwd = 1.2, lty = 2)\nlines(grid_datetime, gp_q2, col = 4, lwd = 1.2, lty =2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks pretty good?

Bayesian approaches offer a coherent framework for parameter inference that can account for multiple sources of uncertainty, while making use of prior information.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the time for the 2024 VectorByte training workshop approaches, we found ourselves reminiscing about last year’s exciting experience in anticipation of this year.\nThe 2023 VectorByte training workshop was held from the 18th to the 20th of July at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. The event welcomed fifteen enthusiastic early-career researchers after months of meticulous planning. Most attendees arrived on the evening of the 17th, traveling by bus from Roanoke Airport, and were greeted by the city’s dramatic weather — a brilliant sunset swiftly followed by rain and thunder.\nThe workshop officially kicked off on the 18th of July. Trainees and trainers gathered for the opening session, where Dr. Lauren Cator introduced the concept of vector traits within the context of vector population dynamics and vector-borne disease transmission. This was followed by an introduction from Dr. Paul Huxley to VecTraits, a VectorByte database that houses thousands of records of vector life history traits across various species and life stages. VecTraits holds over 30,000 rows of fully open trait data, digitized from the literature on known and yet-to-be-determined arthropod vector species, including ticks, mosquitoes, and aphids. Participants were provided with a demonstration showing how to access the database and search for specific traits within it.\nLater in the day, there were hands-on sessions about wrangling data from VecTraits and using it for simple linear modelling. These sessions were designed not only to impart knowledge but also to stimulate discussion and collaboration among participants. Networking and social events were interspersed throughout the day, providing excellent opportunities for attendees to connect and exchange ideas.\nThe second day consisted of more sessions focused on giving participants the skills to answer research questions via more advanced modelling techniques. All the sessions were designed to give participants a chance to see and experience potential applications for the data housed in VecTraits.\nOn the third day, when participants were given the opportunity to apply the skills they learned to projects of their own interest. Participants worked alone or in groups to perform analyses relevant to their field of study. This gave folks the opportunity to do live troubleshooting with seasoned experts. At the end of the day, participants shared what they learned with small groups. It was an invaluable opportunity to gain insights and to forge new professional connections.\nOne of the standout features of the training was the introduction to bayesTPC, an R package designed to easily fit Bayesian thermal performance curves. This package was designed by members of the QED lab and was in the final stages of initial development at the time of the workshop. After a demonstration was provided to show participants how to download and use the package, everyone took time to try using the package on their data set of choice. It served as an excellent opportunity both for participants to ask questions directly to the developers of the package and for the developers to get live feedback.\nThe overall atmosphere was one of mutual support. Participants helped each other understand and apply the concepts, particularly during the practical sessions when trainers might not be immediately available. Many folks began discussing new scientific collaborations that would extend far beyond the end of the workshop dates. To cap off a fantastic meeting, many of the trainees and trainers gathered at a local restaurant for some well-deserved relaxation and camaraderie. The feedback from attendees was overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the value and impact of the training workshop. The 2023 VectorByte training workshop was more than just a series of lectures and practical sessions. It was a vibrant gathering of minds from various research areas, all focused on learning and applying the latest methods in mechanistic vector-borne disease modelling. There is no doubt it will lead to more rapid advancement in a field that is only becoming more important as our climate continues to warm.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
